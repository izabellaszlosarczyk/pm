            Statement of Rights and Responsibilities

            Privacy

            Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use application to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.

            Sharing Your Content and Information

            You own all of the content and information you post on webApp, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:
            For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with this webbApp (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.
            When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).
            When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.  We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.  (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our Data Policy and Platform Page.)
            When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of this app, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
            We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about this application, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).

            Safety

            We do our best to keep  safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to keep  safe, which includes the following commitments by you:
            You will not post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on app.
            You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access this app, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our prior permission.
            You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on this App.
            You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.
            You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.
            You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.
            You will not post content that: is hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.
            You will not develop or operate a third-party application containing alcohol-related, dating or other mature content (including advertisements) without appropriate age-based restrictions.
            You will not use app to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.
            You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of app, such as a denial of service attack or interference with page rendering or other  functionality.
            You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement or our policies.

            Registration and Account Security

            PatternMovesApp users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:
            You will not provide any false personal information on PatternMoves, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.
            You will not create more than one personal account.
            If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission.
            You will not use your personal timeline primarily for your own commercial gain, and will use a PM Page for such purposes.
            You will not use app if you are under 13.
            You will not use app if you are a convicted sex offender.
            You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.
            You will not share your password (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account.
            You will not transfer your account (including any Page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.
            If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).

            Protecting Other People's Rights

            We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.
            You will not post content or take any action on webApp that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law.
            We can remove any content or information you post on PatternMoves if we believe that it violates this Statement or our policies.
            We provide you with tools to help you protect your intellectual property rights. To learn more, visit our How to Report Claims of Intellectual Property Infringement page.
            If we remove your content for infringing someone else's copyright, and you believe we removed it by mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to appeal.
            If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.
            You will not use our copyrights or Trademarks or any confusingly similar marks, except as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
            If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not this App) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it.
            You will not post anyone's identification documents or sensitive financial information on application.

            Mobile and Other Devices

            We currently provide our mobile services for free, but please be aware that your carrier's normal rates and fees, such as text messaging and data charges, will still apply.
            In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you will update your account information on application within 48 hours to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person who acquires your old number.
            You provide consent and all rights necessary to enable users to sync (including through an application) their devices with any information that is visible to them on webApp.

            Termination
